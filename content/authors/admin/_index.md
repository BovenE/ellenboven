I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in Neurosciences at the University of Bristol, U.K. and a visiting scientist at ERASMUS MC Rotterdam, the Netherlands. I have recently completed my PhD at the Sensory and Motor Systems group and Neural and Machine learning group at the university of Bristol. I am passionate about research at the intersection of experimental and computational neuroscience. In my PhD, I use artificial neural networks alongside experimental neuroscience in rodents to understand cerebrocerebellar network function during learning. I strongly believe that the interplay between modern experimental techniques and basic observations of behaviour embedded in a strong theoretical framework is crucial for advancing neurosciencE.
